# Dawson's Discovery World 3D — next tasks

Prioritized unfinished work, highest first. Take the top item that can be done without the user. When a task is done,
remove it here and record it in `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`. Add new findings (bugs, ideas, measurements that look wrong) as you go.

## Waiting for the user
- **Pixel 10 Pro XL canvas-first trial:** build 42 reset on its first local
  view, before any completed GPU batch. Try build 43
  `?graphics=full-basic-shadows&preflight=1&trial=1`. It initializes the real
  shadow map using simple meshes on the game canvas, checks the same meshes
  in the actual HDR startup buffer, and retains the map for gameplay. Copy the
  failure report if it resets: the completed probe list narrows the condition.
  Normal Android must stay on the verified shadow-free profile until confirmed.
- **Longer Pixel play session:** full detail without shadow maps is physically
  confirmed working and is now the normal Android profile. Check a longer play
  session and offline reopening when convenient. The precise failing GPU
  operation within the shadow path remains unisolated.
- **iPhone report #2:** ask for the in-game ⚙️ → Performance Test → Copy Test Results, with Low Power Mode off, after
  tapping "Test the voice". It shows whether the graphics level recovers (build 33), the real frame rate, and whether speech plays.
- **Confirm the squish fix (build 34b)** on the iPhone Home Screen app after turning the phone.

## 1. Performance first (the game must not get slower)
- **Loading:** about 27 s on the software-rendering test machine (`tests/perf/ba.cjs`). Most of it is the whole-world draw
  rehearsal that prevents freezes. Spread it across the first seconds of play in small pieces (keep the freeze checks at 0).
- **The park and creature area are the heaviest views:** about 710k–735k triangles, 165–244 draw calls. Candidates:
  - more instancing for repeated park props;
  - low-detail versions of far creatures;
  - fewer fur shells on far creatures.
- **Castle:** 351 draw calls (the most); merge static castle parts that share a material.

## 2. World expansion (streamed districts in `src/expansion.js`)
- **New regions to the left** (x < -404): an ocean pier, a farm, rainbow mountain. Each needs:
  - a train station (extend `TRAIN.x0` and `STATIONS`);
  - a map picture;
  - gems;
  - 6+ unique picture-only activities.
- **Indoor spaces:** a hidden playroom and a toy-workshop interior (a new layer), with a door in the world, built only when entered.
- **More secret tunnels** (Woods ↔ Toy Town is done), and a picture "tunnel map" once one is found.

## 3. Creatures and pets
- **A pal in the Adventure Trail;** pals react to each other (wave, play) when two follow you.
- **Idle variety:** sitting, sniffing, looking at you.
- **Followers step aside when you turn round.**

## 4. Graphics, animation, controls
- Low-detail trees for the far background hills.
- Softer sea shading.
- Nicer station platforms.

## Known issues
- **The test browser is very slow** (software 3D), so a few smoke checks are timing-sensitive. Run the full test alone,
  and tap moving characters where they are (use `tapChar` or re-aim), never at fixed spots.
