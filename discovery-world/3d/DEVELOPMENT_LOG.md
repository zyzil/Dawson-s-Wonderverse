# Dawson's Discovery World 3D — development log

Completed changes and how each was tested, newest first. Each checkpoint says what was verified, how, and on what (desktop
browser vs. a real iPhone). The routine and rules are in `CLAUDE.md`; unfinished work is in `NEXT_TASKS.md`; measurements
are in `PERFORMANCE_LOG.md`.

## Checkpoint: build 48 — climb into the rocket, the big red button, a real lift-off
- **The bug the family found:** PAW at the rocket blew bubbles. The Lab Gardens rocket (build 45) was placed at x 698, exactly on the bubble fountain. Both had PAW targets at 698, and the fountain's came first in the list. The rocket and its pad now stand at x 686, between the frog pal (678) and the fountain. `ROCKET_PAD` follows it, so flying home lands at 688.5.
- **The rocket ride** is a new ride type in `main.js`, `P.ride = { type: 'rocket', phase }`:
  - **board:** she walks to the door, hops in and disappears. Her portrait shows in the round window as a sprite; the sprite shader is already warmed, so it needs no new shader. Crown, wand and pets stay behind (`G.playerHidden`).
  - **in:** the planet pictures appear. Picking one shows `#blastBtn`, a big pulsing red button with the chosen planet as a badge, and the voice says "Press the big red button!". PAW also presses it. JUMP or ✖ climbs out.
  - **count:** a three-second 3-2-1 with rumble (shake), smoke from the pad and the flame flickering on.
  - **lift:** the rocket accelerates up on a two-cone flame with sparks and smoke. The camera rides up with it, pulled back a little (`G.camLift`, `camT.rk`).
  - **land:** at the destination the rocket starts 26 m up and slows to a gentle touchdown with its flame and a puff of smoke. Then she climbs out beside it.
  - The timing uses the wall clock, so a slow screen doesn't stretch the ride.
- **Every rocket registers itself:** Earth's in `expansion.js`, each planet's in `space.js` (`registerRocket`; it is marked dynamic so scenery slicing never hides it). Because of this the same ride works from every planet. If no rocket is near (the old test path), the picker still flies you straight there.
- **Verified (desktop, software rendering):**
  - A scripted run of PAW → in → Mars → red button → countdown → lift → landing → out → fly home → ✖ climbs out: no page errors, shader programs unchanged (103 at real settings, 138 in `?test`), and no slow shader waits measured around the flight.
  - Screenshots at frozen moments of the countdown, lift-off, high flight and Moon landing.
  - The button sits beside the rocket and overlaps no control at 844×390 or 1024×768.
- **Smoke test:** new checks cover PAW entering the rocket (not bubbles), the red button appearing without flying, and the countdown then lift-off; plus landing and climbing out on the Moon. The planet tests now wait for the ride to finish (`flyTo`).
- **Not yet tried on the real iPhone.**

## Checkpoint: build 47 — every planet its own place, with aliens; builds 46 fixes
- **The family asked** to land on the gas giants too, with fitting activities and different aliens.
  - The gas giants now have walkable swirly cloud ground in their own colours. The voice says, kindly, that each is really made of gas; gravity is still the real 1-bar value.
  - Every place has its own sky colour.
- **Aliens**, one kind per planet: Moonbeams (one-eyed hoppers), Sizzlers (spiky, sunglasses), Floaties (jellyfish), Marslings (three-eyed), Bloonies (balloons), Ringlets (spinning, ringed), Rollers (cubes rolling sideways), Windies (wisps), Heartlings (hearts). Tap one and it greets you with its own sound.
- **Activities that fit each planet:**
  - Moon: flag, five moon rocks to count, Earth.
  - Mercury: the sizzling Sun, a day/night button.
  - Venus: erupting volcanoes, a thermometer.
  - Mars: the driving rover, a dust devil, Olympus Mons.
  - Jupiter: the Great Red Spot, lightning, counting its four big moons.
  - Saturn: ring-ice stepping stones, the hexagon storm, the rings.
  - Uranus: a ball rolling on its side, diamond rain.
  - Neptune: a windsock and gusts that push you, Triton's geyser.
  - Pluto: the slippery icy heart, Charon.
- **Build 46:**
  - **The flying whale vanished:** it had been filed into a scenery section, which is hidden far from the camera. It is now marked as moving. Reproduced on build 45 after flying 160 m; fixed.
  - **The house roof was crooked from above:** the scale was applied before the 45° turn. The turn is now baked into the shape.
- **Verified (desktop):**
  - Full smoke test 180/180 (new: every planet has its alien and 2+ activities; the whale stays in the scene while flying).
  - Device test 11/11; unit tests 25/25; programs 103.
  - Jupiter's hop is measured by the game every physics step (a slow test frame could miss it).

## Checkpoint: build 45 — a warmer voice, and a rocket to the planets with real gravity
- **Voice:**
  - Picks the most natural installed voice: Premium, then Enhanced (on iPhone the quality is in the voice id), then kid-friendly names (Zoe, Ava, Nicky, Samantha…), never "compact".
  - Natural pitch (1.04, a little brighter on excited sentences, 1.1) instead of 1.15, which made synthetic voices sound more robotic; an unhurried pace (0.9–0.96); "..." becomes a pause.
  - ⚙️ lists the installed voices: tap one to hear "Hi Dawson! Let's go and play!" (remembered).
  - The panel tells grown-ups how to download the free Ava/Zoe (Premium) voices on the iPhone.
  - Real device check needed: voices differ per phone.
- **The space rocket** (`src/space.js`):
  - **Launch pad:** in the Lab Gardens (x 698). Tap the rocket or PAW for a picture menu: Earth (home), the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn (with rings), Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.
  - **Each place:** its own scene at x 5000 + 200·i, built on first visit and hidden otherwise:
    - Moon: craters, Earth in the sky and a flag.
    - Mercury: the Sun huge in the sky.
    - Venus: a hazy yellow sky.
    - Mars: red dust and a rover to tap.
    - Gas giants: a floating platform in the clouds, with cloud bands below, the Great Red Spot, and Saturn's rings.
    - Pluto: the white heart and Charon.
  - **Every place:** a striped metre pole, and the voice reports each new jump height.
  - **Real gravity:** game gravity × (g / 9.81), with g = Moon 1.62, Mercury 3.70, Venus 8.87, Mars 3.71, Jupiter 24.79, Saturn 10.44, Uranus 8.69, Neptune 11.15, Pluto 0.62 m/s². For the gas giants g is at the 1-bar cloud tops; they have no surface, and the voice says you're on a floating platform.
  - **Measured jump heights** (same jump): Earth 1.7 m, Moon 11.1, Mars and Mercury 4.8, Pluto 29, Jupiter 0.5, Saturn 1.5, Venus 1.8, Uranus 2.0, Neptune 1.4 m.
  - **Earth** in the menu flies you home to the launch pad.
  - No console errors; programs 103.
- **Build 44** (speed fixes from the real iPhone report) passed 172/172 and 11/11, and ships together with this build.

## Checkpoint: build 44 — fixes from the real iPhone report (build 43)
- **The report:**
  - The flat 30 fps cap is gone (likely Low Power Mode before): castle, house and studio 56–60 fps, but park 44 and creature area 40 fps at the lightest level.
  - Frame work was only 4 ms, so the graphics chip is the limit.
  - One 274 ms freeze "(Art Plaza)"; area changes 59–108 ms; the pool works on the phone.
- **The lightest graphics levels (4–5) now draw less:**
  - trees go to their simple shape beyond 8 m (was 16);
  - no fur layers at all;
  - grass drawn at 70% / 50% of the phone amount.
  - Desktop triangles at level 5 (build 43 → 44): park 560k → 436k (−22%), creatures 669k → 469k (−30%), castle 476k → 404k.
  - Screenshots look nearly the same.
- **The Art Plaza freeze (caused in build 43):**
  - Removing the neighbourhood signposts meant nothing drew a picture sprite early, so the first one met in play (the 🏠 at the Art Plaza end) waited for its shader (`getProgramParameter`, 550 ms on desktop).
  - The start-up rehearsal now draws one sprite (and the sky stairs).
  - Verified: walking 760 → the stairs has 0 long tasks.
  - The new `tests/perf/shaderwaits.cjs` checks the whole train line, the sky, the pool and the underwater world: no shader waits anywhere.
- **The report shows the real build number** (build 43 still said 42).

## Checkpoint: build 43 — the family's list
1. **Camera zoomed out:** CAM_DIST 7.6 → 9.0, plus an automatic pull-back at the Block Builder (like the castle's), so the whole 12 × 5 m wall is on screen. Before, the top rows were cut off.
2. **No more activity signs:**
   - The 7 Learning Corner signposts are now **play spots**: a glowing, sparkling ring on the ground with the corner's 3D toy floating and turning above it. Tapping still opens the games.
   - The floating yellow cone (it covered things) is replaced by a glowing **"stand here" circle** on the path.
   - **Every activity nearby twinkles** now and then (shared particles).
   - The neighbourhood signposts are removed (the map and train show every place).
   - Train-station signs are smaller and lower.
3. **A real seesaw** (Toy Town, x 638): the near end dips down so you can step on; it rocks you between about 0.2 and 1.9 m with a teddy on the other end; JUMP at the top is a super bounce (reached 5.9 m).
4. **The world ends climb into the sky:**
   - **Rainbow stairs:** both ends (x 908 → 932 and −666 → −690) have 24 rainbow cloud steps (0.4 m, walkable) up to a landing at 9.6 m. A rainbow gate there takes you to the Sky Kingdom. The world is a little wider (EXP −698 … 940); saved positions are never restored inside the stairs.
   - **A bigger Sky Kingdom:** the cloud path runs on from x 8 to 45.6. New activities: the moon (tap it and 10 stars light up, counted), cloud sheep (rain, then a rainbow), colour balloons (pop one and it says its colour), and bouncy clouds up to a high cloud with a star. No new star bits, because saved star bits are stored by list position.
5. **Steer the sky whale:**
   - ◀ ▶ / sideways drag fly it anywhere over the world (11 m/s); ▲ ▼ fly higher and lower (6–32 m). Areas stream in as you fly.
   - ▲ no longer throws you off; JUMP hops off and you float down gently (fall speed capped).
   - The camera pulls back and looks down while flying.
   - After a long flight the whale swims home out of sight.
6. **The deep pool and the underwater world** (`src/sea.js`):
   - A Splash Pool next to the beach (x −12 to −4). Tap it to dive into a deep tiled pool (its own place at x 3000+, built on first dive, hidden otherwise).
   - Swim down; a tunnel at the bottom leads into a 120 m underwater world: colour coral, 4 fish schools, a sea turtle, an octopus that squirts ink, glowing jellyfish, a shipwreck with a treasure chest (count 5 pearls), a clam, dolphins, a big whale far away, starfish, crabs, a shrimp, seaweed and bubbles.
   - Swim up to the top of the pool to climb out.
- **Merged-code lessons:**
  - `c.sprite` is now `c.toy` (3D toy models).
  - Every emoji in `expansion.js`, `learn.js` and now `sea.js` needs a toy model; the test caught 💕, 🗺️, 🪸 and 🏊, even inside comments and messages.
  - `G.sea` is the beach's sea plane, so the underwater world is `G.deepSea`.
- **Verified (desktop):**
  - Every feature by script: builder wall fits; seesaw heights 0.17 → 1.88 and a 5.9 m bounce; both stairs climbed and the gate → sky; whale flew 43 m right and up to 25 m, ▲ kept the ride, JUMP → float; pool → tunnel → all 10 sea activities → climb out, with shader programs 104 → 104.
  - `ba.cjs` 42 → 43, two runs each: park 10.9 → 11.1, creatures 8.7 → 9.6, castle 8.7 → 9.7 ms average. Each view was faster in one run and slower in the other: within noise. 0 long tasks; programs 102 → 102.
  - Unit tests 25/25 (the toy-model test now also scans `sea.js`).

## Checkpoint: build 42 — freezes say where; Clover the goat; friends play together (built on top of builds 40 and 41 from main)
- **The performance report says where each freeze over 250 ms happened:** the place name (Park, Toy Town, Ocean Pier…), the house, castle or underground, any ride, or a learning game. The build 36 iPhone report had two real 309–339 ms freezes with no location.
  - Verified (desktop): two deliberate 400 ms freezes are reported as "(Ocean Pier)" and "(in the house)". Other examples seen: "Park", "Playhouse, riding the slide".
- **Clover the mountain goat 🐐** lives on the Adventure Trail (x 494), the only neighbourhood that had no pal. Three taps to befriend; follows you; appears in 🐾 (9 pals); the save accepts `goat`.
  - Verified (desktop): befriends and follows to the park; no console errors. Shader programs on that route are 103 with and without Clover (build 39 gives the same 103), so no new shaders.
- The report's build number is 42.
- **Friends who follow you play together:** when two or more pals follow you and you stand still, now and then two neighbours face each other and hop, with hearts and a giggle (no new objects or shaders).

## Checkpoint: build41 — 3D pet nursery, creative play and world improvements

- Three original nursery pets hatch through picture-led play. Feeding, bathing, brushing, catch, optional bedtime, per-pet room colors, saved outfits and blankets use the same sculpted 3D pets, toy materials and real furnishings as the existing game. No declining needs, waiting or absence penalties.
- A shared viewport moves the existing renderer into native playrooms and restores it on close. World simulation pauses; cache and input ownership remain separate. Artwork is saved compactly and applied to actual fabric and framed surfaces.
- All41 learning activities use native 3D toys while retaining levels, demonstrations, voice, rewards and interaction targets. Physical world animals, fish, shells, gems, flowers and prizes are native cached single-draw models. Picture navigation, clues and editable artwork remain interfaces/surfaces.
- Fixed saved-builder removal after scene reparenting, hidden/detached targets receiving taps, temporary-resource cleanup, feeding visibility, repeated/stale learning rewards, demo progress, drag/paint cancellation, overlapping drop targets, X phonics, calm toy motion and scaled tablet HUD overlap.
- Core rendering/creature work reductions and eight-view performance measurements are recorded in PERFORMANCE_LOG.md. Results vary by view; no universal speedup or physical-iPhone result is claimed.
- Verification on desktop software rendering:
  - Full world sweep: **158/159 assertions passed**, with no console errors/warnings. The remaining fixed-duration stair hold stopped at k≈.992 before the top. A targeted real-touch rerun passed the exact null-stair/y=4.4 criterion, plus partway stop and downstairs checks, using bounded condition-based holds. Game JavaScript was unchanged; the subsequent HUD-only correction retained the identical compiled JavaScript hash. The original full report is retained honestly in tests/TEST_RESULTS.json; resolution is in tests/BUILD41_TARGETED_RESULTS.json.
  - Native nursery browser checks passed for hatching, all care, 3D snack dragging, real mouse/touch drawing, blankets/outfits, sleep/wake, reload with old collections, four nursery layouts and home entry.
  - All41 native learning scenes passed, including distinct model semantics, calm motion, actual hidden/detached raycasts and renderer restoration.
  - Both existing adventure integration/regression suites passed.11 changed HUD viewport layouts passed; these were viewport resizing checks, not eleven separate device identities or physical-device results.
  -24 state/audio/render-work unit cases passed, plus builder/model-swap regressions,337 one-draw model checks,58 distinctions and learning source contracts.
- One offline build41 bundle, cachev41 and previous published backup retained. The user merges the single release PR; real-iPhone playtesting remains a follow-up.

## Checkpoint: build 40 — connected adventures, one release

- Eleven optional picture adventures connect Fluffkin rescue, companions, learning, regional activities, art and Ocean Pier treasure. Progress and rewards are saved by stable event IDs; repeated/out-of-order discoveries cannot duplicate prizes.
- A picture/voice discovery book records sea creatures and places. Home and Art Plaza galleries keep compact painting and building previews, with saved souvenirs and a cushion choice. The pattern reward starts a small moving train in the house.
- Regional additions include an owl search with visible and audible clues, persistent snow friend, varied deterministic fishing catches, reusable shell clue, harvest/feeding milestones, sea discoveries and learning flowers.
- Illustrated map destinations show discovered activity pictures. The paw prompt shares its target selection with the indicator. Optional guide controls are at least 44 px and hide while creative tool trays are visible.
- Independent voice/music/effect settings, calm effects and gentle controls retain the existing master mute. Calm bubble, float/sink and magnet activities retain static visible outcomes. Musical creatures, castle toys and marble bins use the music channel.
- Existing save key and fields remain intact. Completed rescues can retell their story through pictures without resetting rescued babies. A detached home display is removed from both scene traversal and outdoor tap targets.
- Verified on desktop Chromium / SwiftShader (not an actual iPhone):
  - Full existing game smoke suite: **159/159**, no console errors or warnings, including old save/reload, creatures, rides, painting, building, farm, pier and learning checks.
  - Final focused adventure integration and regression suites passed after the home-display, music-routing and narrow-screen follow-ups. They check real activity callbacks, save reload, guide restoration, rescue replay, home routing, calm learning, music sources, woodland persistence, train movement and creative tray access.
  - Pure adventure state **8/8** and comfort/audio **3/3** tests passed.
  - **11 unique emulated screen sizes** passed. An older-iPad screenshot exceeded the device harness's original 30 s capture allowance; its rerun with the same 240 s screenshot allowance as the smoke harness passed every unchanged game/layout/touch assertion. Device results are in `screenshots/devices/RESULTS.json`.
  - Before/after performance and earned-reward measurements recorded in PERFORMANCE_LOG.md and tests/PERFORMANCE_BUILD40.json. Shader count remains 101; far home display detaches.
- Built to one offline HTML file; service-worker cache version is build 40. Previous published HTML retained in backups.
- After merging the newer main: rebuilt the HTML; reran all 11 unit checks, both focused adventure browser suites, and all three graphics-cap scenarios successfully on desktop Chromium.
- Delivery: repository access is now installed and the combined release is uploaded as PR #46. Latest main fixes for the iPhone graphics cap are retained; the PR is left for the user to merge.


## Checkpoint: build 39 — fixes from the first real iPhone report of the new builds
- **The report (iPhone, iOS 18.7, Home Screen app, build 36, 844×390 at 3×):**
  - start-up 3.8–4.8 s; moving between areas 130–300 ms; worst test frames 38–78 ms; frame work 7.7–8 ms;
  - a flat 30 fps everywhere (even the light house interior), so the phone is capping it. Likely Low Power Mode; the user has been asked.
  - Voice works: the sound button was off, and "Test the voice" spoke and finished a sentence.
- **Fixed:**
  1. **Time in the background no longer counts as a frame.** The report showed a "10,412 ms freeze": the app was in the background while the results were copied.
  2. **A 30 fps cap is recognised by trying.**
     - On the iPhone, the automatic graphics went 4→5→4 under the cap: a worse picture for nothing.
     - Now, when frames are at about 30 fps and seem slow, the picture drops to the lowest level for 6 s. If even that isn't faster, it is a cap: back to the previous level, no more lowering while the cap lasts, and the build 33 "room to spare" rule may raise the quality.
     - If it IS faster, the device really is slow: one level lower than before, and the "room to spare" rule is switched off (it measures CPU time only).
  3. **The report shows the real build number** (it always said "build 26").
- **Verified (desktop):** `tests/perf/capcheck.cjs` feeds recorded frame times to the automatic graphics:
  - (A) a jumpy 30 fps cap like the iPhone's: one 6 s test, then the best picture (level 0);
  - (B) a genuinely slow device (22 fps): steps down to level 5;
  - (C) a GPU-bound device at 30 fps that is faster when lowered: test, then level 3 (60 fps).
  - The first versions of this logic failed (C) twice; both were fixed before this checkpoint.
  - `ba.cjs` runs with adaptive quality off, so it can't show this change.
  - The full smoke test result is recorded in the commit after this entry.
- **Build 38 (🌊 Ocean Pier) after merge:** full smoke test 159/159, device test 10/10.

## Checkpoint: build 38 — 🌊 Ocean Pier (merged as #44)
- New district (x -668 to -536) with 7 activities (fishing, tide pool, musical buoys, dolphin, treasure, sailboat, whale), crates and gems g17–g18, Splash the seal 🦭, and a 🌊 station (20 stations).
- Walking in: 0 long tasks, programs 101 → 101, 71 calls and 104k triangles.
- `ba.cjs` 37 → 38: no slower. Full smoke test 159/159; device test 10/10.
- An 835 ms long task happened once on a train trip (x 202) and did not reproduce in 2 more runs of each build: on the task list.

## Checkpoint: build 37 — the castle draws much less
- **Castle front merged:** 162 still, untapped parts of the build 16 castle front (steps, railings, shutters, flower boxes, climbing roses, hedges, topiary, lanterns, rose window, banners) are merged into one shape per *look-alike* material.
  - The code made a new material object for every part, so the parts are grouped by what the material looks like: type, colours, roughness, textures and so on.
  - The castle group goes from 213 meshes to 67. No new shaders, because the materials are the same.
- **Verified (desktop, software rendering):**
  - `tests/perf/calls.cjs` at x 398: 221 → 163 draw calls per frame (castle group 89 → 31).
  - `tests/perf/ba.cjs` 36 → 37:
    - castle calls 562 → 319; script ms/frame park 13.2 → 11.2, creatures 10.6 → 8.9, castle 11.8 → 9.9;
    - 0 long tasks; geometries 1514 → 1372; programs 101.
  - Before/after screenshots of the castle front show the same parts.
  - Full smoke test 155/155.

## Checkpoint: build 36 — one game for every phone and tablet (Apple and Android)
- **Screen fitting:**
  - The picture is drawn at the canvas's real on-screen size: no stretching (build 34b), with a ResizeObserver plus a twice-a-second safety check.
  - **Camera:** on screens squarer than about 2:1 (iPads are 4:3), the vertical view angle opens part of the way (38° → about 47–49°), so the sides stay in view instead of looking zoomed in. Phones are unchanged.
  - **Pixel budget:** the picture is drawn at no more than 1.0 M pixels on phones, 1.6 M on tablets and 3 M on desktops (Performance mode: 60% of that). Phones are already under it; dense tablet screens no longer draw 2–3× a phone's pixels.
- **Interface:**
  - `--ui` scale: 1 on phones (never smaller), up to 1.35 on tablets. Controls use transforms, so the arrow pad's direction maths still works.
  - Top buttons are at least 46 px. On narrow phones the right-hand group wraps onto a second row instead of running off the screen.
  - The 🗺️ and 🐾 panels size their tiles from the screen's width and height and wrap; the grown-ups' panel, title card and memory cards fit short screens.
  - The title label is hidden on touch screens (the bigger tablet buttons covered it).
  - The station strip wraps instead of scrolling (pictures past the edge were unreachable by touch) and opens below the top buttons.
  - The "turn me sideways" picture shows on every touch screen held upright, including tablets.
- **Platform:**
  - Full screen and a landscape lock where the browser allows them (Android Chrome, iPad Safari; not iPhone Safari, where the Home Screen app is the full-screen way). PLAY asks for full screen on touch devices in a browser tab; there is a ⛶ button in ⚙️.
  - Sound resumes after a call or an app switch on iPhone (the 'interrupted' state).
  - Every button is released when the app is hidden.
  - Device detection: iPad (which reports itself as a Mac), Android tablet vs phone, Home Screen app.
- **⚙️ Graphics:** Auto (measured frame times, as before) or a fixed Quality, Balanced or Performance mode, remembered on the device.
- **Verified (desktop Chromium emulation only — real iPhones, iPads and Android devices still need testing):**
  - `tests/devices.cjs` covers 10 screens: iPhone SE, iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad 7, iPad Pro 11, Pixel 5, Galaxy S9+, Galaxy Tab S4, a 640×360 Android and a 21:9 Android. **10/10 pass:**
    - the picture fills the screen unstretched;
    - every button is on screen, at least 45 px, with no overlaps;
    - the map, pets and station panels fit, including next to the top buttons;
    - holding ▶ walks, letting go stops, and JUMP jumps;
    - held upright, the "turn sideways" picture shows.
    - The first run found real phone problems (buttons 34–42 px, ⚙️ off screen on narrow phones); those were fixed. Looking at the screenshots found two more (the covered title label on tablets, the strip covering the second button row); those were fixed and the test now checks them.
  - `tests/perf/ba.cjs` 35 → 36, side by side: script ms/frame park 14.3 → 10.0, creatures 16.1 → 8.2, castle 12.9 → 12.2 (run-to-run noise is about ±4 ms on this machine); 0 long tasks; programs 101; memory unchanged.

## Checkpoint: build 35 — 🚜 Happy Farm
- **New region: 🚜 Happy Farm** (x -536 to -404, left of Frosty Peaks). Streamed like the other districts, with shared materials only. 11 picture-only activities:
  - **Barn:** the doors open and an animal says hello (horse, cow, goat, sheep, rooster, with its sound and name).
  - **Hen:** lays eggs; count to five and the chicks hatch.
  - **Rainbow sheep:** her wool changes colour and she says the colour.
  - **Haystack:** climb the bales and bounce on top; gem g15 floats above it.
  - **Vegetable patch:** seed → sprout → carrot → pull it up, and count.
  - **Apple tree:** apples drop into the basket; count to five.
  - **Windmill:** tap it to make it spin.
  - **Duck pond:** the ducklings follow their mother in a line.
  - **Toy tractor:** drives across the field and back.
  - **Mud puddle with piglets,** and cows mooing in the field.
  - **Gem g16** at the end of the path.
- **New pal: Truffle the piglet 🐷.** Three taps to befriend; follows you; appears in 🐾. The save accepts the new `pig` key.
- **Train:** the line is extended to x -534 with a 🚜 station (19 stations). The map gets 🚜 automatically from `DISTRICTS`.
- **Ground:** a lawn zone, the cobble path, the front rail and a few trees behind the fields.
- **Bug fixed:** Frosty Peaks' falling snow followed you onto the farm. It now only falls in Frosty Peaks.
- **Test fix:** the first walking check now waits for frames to settle. It failed once (1.9 m vs. more than 2) in the first seconds after start-up on the slow test machine.
- **Verified (desktop, software rendering):**
  - Walking into the farm from Frosty Peaks: 0 long tasks; shader programs 101 → 101; 90 draw calls, 270k triangles.
  - `tests/perf/ba.cjs` 34c → 35: script ms/frame unchanged (park 13.5 → 13.7, creatures 11.9 → 11.4, castle 13.2 → 14.0, all within run-to-run noise); 0 long tasks everywhere; memory 121 → 122 MB, programs 101 → 101.
  - Train to 🚜: whole line arrives, 19 picture tiles, 0 frames near an unbuilt district.
  - Screenshots of the barn, pigs, sheep, windmill and tractor look right.

## Checkpoint: build 34c (user request)
- **Removed the big pink wall** at x -1.5, by the train at the start of the playhouse (requested with a screenshot). It was the old left edge of the world. The world now continues left and the train runs through there, so it only blocked the view.
  - It was scenery only (no collision, nothing referenced it).
  - **Verified (desktop):** the view by the train is clear; walking left from x 1 reaches x -14 with no errors.

## Checkpoint: build 34b (urgent fix)
- **"Squished" picture on iPhone (reported with a screenshot):** when the phone turned, Safari could still report the upright size. The game then drew a tall picture and stretched it across the wide screen, so it looked blocky, zoomed in and too wide.
  - **Fix:** the picture is now sized from the canvas's real size on screen. It is rechecked every frame (a cheap comparison) and on orientation and visual-viewport changes.
  - **Reproduced and verified (desktop):** the browser was made to report the stale upright size after turning. Build 34 drew 292×633 onto an 844×390 screen; 34b draws 633×292.
- **Measuring scripts** are now kept in `tests/perf/` (`ba`, `walknew`, `train`, `soak`, `sweep`, `house2`, `movers`, `chunkchk`), so later sessions can reuse them. Run them from `discovery-world/3d` with the html file as the argument.

## Checkpoint: build 34
- **Express train:** picture trips longer than about 280 m speed up to 36 m/s (was always 20). The whole line takes about 42 s of game time, down from about 68 s. Short trips are unchanged.
- **Verified (desktop, `tests/perf/train.cjs`, before → after):**
  - trip home → 🌈: top speed 20 → 36 m/s, long tasks 1 (50 ms) → 0;
  - whole line 🌈 → ❄️: long tasks 0 → 0;
  - frames where you were within 25 m of an area that had not finished building: 0 → 0, on both trips.
  - On a phone each frame moves the train less and builds the same amount, so streaming has more margin there than on the test machine.

## Checkpoint: build 33
- **First real iPhone report (build 26):** no freezes, house about 134 ms, start-up 7 s. A flat 30 fps cap (most likely Low Power Mode), but the graphics were stuck at the lowest level.
  - **Fixed:** the stale level is forgotten (new key), and quality steps back up when capped with room to spare (frame work < 9 ms for 20 s).
- **Crown bug (introduced in build 25):** the crown, your shadow and the PAW hint were filed into scenery slices and hidden far from where they were made.
  - **Fixed:** they are marked dynamic.
  - **New test:** checks that no mover sits in a slice.
- **Luna gives a magic wand** (saved).
- **To verify next:** the iPhone report after this build. Expect a graphics level below 5 and frame work in ms. Ask for Low Power Mode off, to see the uncapped fps.

## Checkpoint: build 32
- **Added:**
  - Bolt the robot, Hoppy the frog and Kiwi the parrot (6 pals in all).
  - The secret tunnel Woods ↔ Toy Town.
- **Verified (desktop):** all three befriend and follow; 0 new shaders; the tunnel works both ways and builds the destination on arrival.
- **Tests:** map and station pictures are found by emoji; Biscuit is tapped from his left.
- **Full test:** the result is recorded in the commit after this entry.

## Checkpoint: build 31

**Added**
- **❄️ Frosty Peaks** (x -272 to -404) has 9 activities:
  - a sledding hill: climb the steps, tap the sled, slide down (it reuses the slide ride);
  - a snowman to build in 5 taps;
  - snowball toss at a target;
  - a slippery ice pond you glide across;
  - an igloo that glows warm;
  - northern lights;
  - waddling penguins;
  - Pebble the penguin pal;
  - falling snow.
- **Gems:** 2 more (14 total).
- **Train:** extended to x -402, with a ❄️ station.
- **🐾 My Pets panel:** shows each befriended friend. Tap to bring it along (💖) or send it home (🏠); friends not met yet show as ❓.
- **Followers:** they now walk in front of the path, each in its own spot, so they no longer overlap the workshop pets or each other.

**Verified (desktop)**
- **Bug sweep** over the whole world, both ways: never stuck, no console errors. The only detours were the intended slides, lift and ball pit.
- **Walk into Frosty Peaks:** 0 long tasks, 0 new shader programs.
- **Activities:** all 10 tappables run without errors.
- **Sled:** slides from y 4.5 at x -332 to the ground at x -345.
- **Ice:** you glide 2.1 m after letting go.
- **Pets panel:** toggles following.

## Checkpoint: build 30 (merged as #37)
- **Train:** runs the whole world with 17 stations, a picture strip and automatic trips; no teleport turn-arounds or pop-ins.
- **New regions:** 🏖️ Sunny Seaside and 🌲 Whispering Woods.
- **Pets:** Pinchy and Rusty.
- **Fixes:** left-side gems couldn't be collected; reloading lost progress in the new areas.
- **Full test:** 147/147.

## Checkpoint: build 29b (merged as #36)
- **Freezes fixed:** entering the house (2.9 s → 0), the Dino Kingdom and the castle (four 1–2.7 s stalls → 0). Causes: shader and driver rehearsal into the wrong kind of buffer, too few rehearsal spots, and late creatures.
- **New neighbourhoods:** four streamed neighbourhoods to the right with 23 activities, the 🗺️ map and 🏠 home.
